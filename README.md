<p>
 	Penetration testing tools in Python. I wrote these to test the security of the forms I build for work in React.js. I built a form to test code-injection tools.  Below are a list of the security tests that I run on applications that contain forms.
</p>

<h3>Security Tests</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/jchiefelk/pentesting/tree/master/portscan">Port Scanning</a>

<a href="https://github.com/jchiefelk/pentesting/tree/master/xss">XSS Scripting with test forms and RESTful API</a>

<a href="https://github.com/jchiefelk/pentesting/tree/master/bruteforce">Brute Force Password</a>

<h3>Test Form</h3>

<p>
  To test SQL Injection tools, open 2 tabs on your terminal and go to form directory in one of them.  Perform the 
  following first to launch the RESTful API locally
</p>

<pre>
cd form
npm install
npm run prod_start
</pre>

<p>
This most likely will crash becuase you need to add the parameters to your local SQL database in the config.js file,
located in the modules folder.  The testform saves the first and last name of the users in a table I called in my local MySQL database "Users".
</p>

<pre>
var config = {
	development: {
		database: {
			host: '127.0.0.1',
			user: 'root',
			password: '',
			database: 'Users'
		}
	}
};
module.exports = config;
</pre>


<p>
	Once you have settup your database, in your other window run the Python script that is in the sqlinjection folder.
</p>

<pre>
	python3 sqlinjector.py
</pre>
