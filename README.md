<p>
  To test SQL Injection tools, open 2 tabs on your terminal and go to form directory in one of them.  Perform the 
  following to launch the RESTful API locally
</p>

<pre>
cd form
npm install
npm run prod_start
</pre>

<p>
This most likely will crash becuase you need to add the parameters to your local SQL database in the config.js file,
located in the modules folder.
</p>
<pre>
var config = {
	development: {
    expectedPassword: '',
		database: {
			host: '127.0.0.1',
			user: 'root',
			password: '',
			database: ''
		}
	}
};
module.exports = config;
</pre>
