<h1>SQL Injection</h1>


<p>
  SQL Injection is an old and still super common attack method used by Hackers to acquire the contents of a websites database, that is if it is a SQL-based database. 
</p>

<p>
  SQL injections proceed by inserting SQL code into a user-form form that accepts and updates information stored in a database.  This could instructions to the SQL database to delete or dump its contents to the attacker, or a number of other mischievious things.
</p>

<p>
  As a software developer that wants to engineer a form that is secure against a SQL injection attack, it is super easy to build.  All one needs to do is use something called a "Prepared Statement"
</p>


<h3>Prepared Statements</h3>

<p> A prepared statement is a prescribed SQL command that defined in the applications source code, and is performed every single time the database is updated.  It essentially santizies user input to prevent SQL code being executed when the database is updated.
</p>

<p>
  An example prepared statement below from the script databasetools.js contained in the modules folder
</p>

<pre>
  /*** 
  // sterilized sql
  return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
      var Insert = [item.firstname, item.lastname, item.subject, item.abstract, item.article.value];
      var sql = 'insert into Pending set first_name=?, last_name=?, subject=?, abstract=?, article=?';
      connect.query(sql,Insert,function(err, rows) {
      	 
          if (err) {
            reject(err);
          }  else {
            resolve(rows.info.insertId);
          }
      });
	});
  ***/
</pre>

<p>
  If you were to uncomment this code block, re-bundle the JavaScript, and then re-run sqlinjection.py the output would be
