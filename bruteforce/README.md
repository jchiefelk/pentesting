<h1>Brute Force Password Cracker</h1>

<p>
  Brute-force password cracking of login authentication forms built with React.js.  
</p>

<p>
To get started, first clone the repo of the <a href="https://github.com/jchiefelk/flask-react-form">flask-react-form<a>, and install the necessary JavaScript and Python modules.  Next create a file that contains a list of words that may make up a user's password. In the case of the password is 'mice3333' and the username is 'admin' for the flask-react-form.  Hypothetically these are suppose to be any set of strings that may make up a potential target's password. Thse are strings that could have been collected by a keyboard logger, or some social engineering
</p>

<p>
   This script uses itertools to create a list of possible permutations of 2 string combinations.  It then loops through the list of possible passwords.  Selenium is used to make the http requests because Mechanize does not detect HTML rendered to a virtual DOM by JavaScript.  PhantomJS is used to run virtual broswer.
</p>

<p>
  To test against flask-react-form, run the following
<p>

<pre>
	python3 brute_selenium.py
</pre>

<p>
	You'll then be prompted to enter in username(admin) and name of password list file.
